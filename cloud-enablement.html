                <p>First Data had 10000+ devices (Catalyst 6500, ISR etc...) in their global network which included Cisco, Nokia and Avaya. CA Spectrum was used as the primary event manager and received approx. 3 Million+ events per day and 10 thousand alarms which were then handled by Network Operation Center (NOC) on a daily basis. Also approximately 100 Incident reports were generated to CA ServiceDesk system. Addressing each alarm with such high volumes in extremely short amount of time was overwhelming for NOC team.</p>

                <p>Netpace CIAN solution based on Cisco Process Orchestrator (CPO) played a significant role by automating incident management/troubleshooting tasks which would otherwise had to be addressed manually. CIAN was used as a Virtual TAC in the NOS for the reactive issues including critical alarms such as circuit failure or device down situations.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of this implementation was Proactive monitoring and configuration consistency check such as Failover on FWSM, this activity saved time for the design team so that they can focus on more important business related issues. CPO also had to be integrated with the CA Spectrum in order to update the Alarms and also update the CA ServiceDesk ticket.</p>

                    <li> US BANK receives millions of network events from 10000+ devices in their network. Netcool raises about 100000+ alarms/month to the NOC, and the NOC has to respond to these alarms quickly.</li>
                    <li> CPO was positioned to integrate with Netcool so that critical alarms that require in depth troubleshooting would be forwarded to CPO for troubleshooting while raising alarms and also service desk ticket simultaneously.</li>
                    <li> US BANK wanted “ticket enrichment” to augment their resources in the Network Operation Center (NOC).</li>
                    <li> Addressing every alarm with such a high volume was overwhelming and time consuming for the NOC team.</li>

<p>Bureau of Prisons network had 2,500+ network devices in their national network which primarily included Cisco catalyst switches and routers. Also their wide area network, complexes/institutional networks used tools such as CiscoWorks, Tandberg camera and Cisco Unified Communication. This project presented several opportunities to perform network automation and extensive strategies/designs were employed.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Prisons NOC was interested in enhancing and maintaining the stability of their network by automating complicated/time consuming tasks and creating automated troubleshooting to aid in identifying issues, when they do arise.</p>
